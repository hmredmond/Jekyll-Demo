Javascript Files:

the original source is in the _src folder. 

Using Gulp during the build process, the files are minified and babel'd into the root of the JS folder

THESE TREATED FILES ARE THE ONES REFERENCED BY THE SITE. 

js/_src = original, custom scripts
js = generated , minified scripts used in site

Note:
The search-utilities file requires babel as it contains litoral templates which are not supported by IE.
