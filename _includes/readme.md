# _Includes

The _includes folder contains all of the html components for the site. 

It is assumed that any snippet of markup which is to be reused would be saved in this folder. 


## Icons (svg)

This folder contains the svg markup for specific icons. 

These can be used in the jekyll markdown as follows:

{% include icons/[filename].svg %}

Please note that IE requires a height and width on all svgs in order to display correctly.
