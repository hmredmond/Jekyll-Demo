# PAGES

To match SiteLeafs naming convention, all files in this folder should have the .markdown extension. 

The pages folder is a Jekyll System folder. 

All markdown created in this folder will default to the page.html layout (as specified in the _config.yml file)

NOTE - Because this is a system type, there are no tags or category fields. In order to make use of these fields, please create a custom collection in which to contain pages (e.g. information pages)
