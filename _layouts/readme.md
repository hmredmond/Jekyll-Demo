## Layouts

Layouts are the selectable templates available. 

Each has the ability to be customised to display the layout of the page as required. 

For a good example - see the differences between the page and posts layouts. 

There can be as many layouts as required - all defining the page body of each page. 

These layouts all inherit from the same base.html template. This means ensures that the page head and script imports are consistent and only need to be updated in one place.
