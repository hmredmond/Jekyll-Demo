# Menus

To match SiteLeafs naming convention, all files in this folder should have the .markdown extension. 

Menu files are a way of defining what items appear in the menus on the site. 

There are two standard menus types. More can be added by following the same pattern.  

## Primary Navigation

Items in the primary navigation (i.e. the menu which appears at the top of the site) are referenced in the _includes/header.html file. 

## Footer Navigation

Items in this markdown file will appear in the footer of the site, and therefore referenced in the _includes/footer.html markup file. 

## Configuration

If a menu is set to hidden, it will not appear on the site. 

You can add as many menu items to the lists as you want, but the menus may wrap around and lose UI form/ style if too many are used.
